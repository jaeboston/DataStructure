NOTE: excluding the 

Task0:
O(1): just print 2 lines

Task 1:
Two for loops to iterate thru each of the rows in the two lists
and a print statement
O(2n) + O(1) = O(n)

Task 2:
One for loop to iterate thru each of the row in the list
and a print statement
O(n) + O(1) = O(n)

Task 3:
One for loop to iterate thru each of the row in the list, sorting the set and print statements
O(n) + O(klogk) (where k is subset of n) + O(1) = O(nlogn)

Task 4:
Two for loops to iterate thru each of the rows in the two lists, sorting the set and print statements
O(2n) + O(klogk) (where k is subset of n) + O(1) = O(nlogn)
